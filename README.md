This Business Intelligence Analytics Project examines a retail dataset encompassing item details, pricing,
discounts, ratings, and delivery information. Our objective is to extract actionable insights for optimizing
pricing strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction, and improving operational efficiency. Leveraging
advanced analytics, we aim to uncover patterns and trends to inform data-driven decision-making. In the
existing landscape, retail analytics has led to personalized marketing, dynamic pricing, supply chain
optimization, sentiment analysis, inventory management, recommendation systems, and delivery time
optimization. This project builds upon these approaches, focusing on specific dataset attributes to drive
transformative insights for the retail and shopping industry.
